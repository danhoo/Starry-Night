# Starry-Night
Re-creation of a classic screensaver

A from-scratch (thanks to Evan Green) recreation of a Berkeley Systems After Dark classic
module.  If you enable "Retro Colors" (e.g. grayscale) and squint a bit, you can
pretend your Mac has traveled back in time and become a Mac Classic.

Version 1.01 updated to build using XCode 14 and run on 10.14 or later.

Credit for the original Starry Night belongs to Berkeley Systems.
