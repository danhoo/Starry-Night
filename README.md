# Starry-Night
Re-creation of a classic screensaver

A from-scratch (thanks to Evan Green) recreation of a Berkeley Systems After Dark classic
module.  If you enable "Retro Colors" (e.g. grayscale) and squint a bit, you can
pretend your Mac has traveled back in time and become a Mac Classic.

Uses Cocoa drawing calls that should work on any Mac running Mac OS 10.5 or later.

Note that in preview mode, the screensaver doesn't currently take into account the
smaller view and draws the same number of buildings that would be drawn in the full
screen mode, so this may not be an accurate preview of the generated building layout.

Credit for the original Starry Night belongs to Berkeley Systems.
